# Electron Demo

Simple electron starter app since if you ask me the official [Electron-Starter](https://github.com/atom/electron-starter/blob/master/src/renderer/main.coffee) seems way too 
complicated.  

## Features 

* ES6 support (via babel)
* eslint
* Less CSS
* Mithril + MSX (could be swapped for React/JSX)

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```
Changes will be rebuilt automatically, but you will still have to `Ctrl-R` 
in the app window to reload changes.

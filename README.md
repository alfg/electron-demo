# Electron Demo

Simple [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) (formerly Atom Shell) boilerplate app 
since if you ask me the official [Electron-Starter](https://github.com/atom/electron-starter) 
seems overly-complicated.  

## Features 

* ES6 support (via babel) + eslint
* Less CSS
* Browserify
* Mithril + MSX (could be swapped for React/JSX)

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```
Changes will be rebuilt automatically, but you will still have to `Ctrl-R` 
in the app window to reload changes.
